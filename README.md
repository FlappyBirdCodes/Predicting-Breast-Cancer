# Predicting-Breast-Cancer
This is a logistic regression model that uses previous data inputs to predict whether or not a patient has breast cancer. This is a simple algorithm and my first program involving machine learning.

# Data cleaning
In this particular dataset, the data is already in integer value, meaning that no cleaning is neccesary. Additionally, all of the indvidual inputs have some correlation with the output, which is why no columns were removed. 

# Conclusion
The accuracy of this algorithm is 91.21%.
